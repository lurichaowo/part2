At first running of make, it didn't compile completely. Makefile was adjusted to compile everything with "make".
Program itself did not return anything correct.

* Extra unecessary files were removed.
* Changed unindenting program to getline instead of >>, to delimit on new lines.
h3 unindenting
* Corrected methods inside while. 
* Added a break since no helper was used to move loop forward.
* Removed unecessary getline.

h3 indenting
* In order to not change the general structure and work with original idea,
* Created an std::stringstream to store the unindented file.
* Changed b_count when { is first character. 
* Added the line substring as it was forgotten
